Now, when I was just a little boy
Standin' to my Daddy's knee
My poppa said, "Son, don't let the man get you
Do what he done to me."
'Cause he'll get you
'Cause he'll get you now, now

And I can remember The Fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou, oh, oh

Wish I was back on the Bayou
Rollin' with some Cajun Queen
Wishin' I were a fast freight train
I'm just a-chooglin' on down to New Orleans

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou, do it, do it, do it, do it

Oh, Lord
Oh, get back, boy

And I can remember The Fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou

All right! Do, do, do, do
Mm, oh
