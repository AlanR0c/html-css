    Now, when I was just a little boy
    Standin' to my Daddy's knee
    My papa said, "Son, don't let the man get you
    Do what he done to me."
    'Cause he'll get you
    'Cause he'll get you now, now

    And I can remember The Fourth of July
    Runnin' through the backwood bare
    And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
    Chasin' down a hoodoo there
    Chasin' down a hoodoo there

    Born on the Bayou
    Born on the Bayou
    Born on the Bayou, oh, oh

    Wish I was back on the Bayou
    Rollin' with some Cajun Queen
    Wishin' I were a fast freight train
    I'm just a-chooglin' on down to New Orleans

    Born on the Bayou
    Born on the Bayou
    Born on the Bayou, do it, do it, do it, do it

    Oh, Lord
    Oh, get back, boy

    And I can remember The Fourth of July
    Runnin' through the backwood bare
    And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
    Chasin' down a hoodoo there
    Chasin' down a hoodoo there

    Born on the Bayou
    Born on the Bayou
    Born on the Bayou

    All right! Do, do, do, do
    Mm, oh
