    <h1>Image load test</h1>
    <p>Here we're going to see an image that's inside the same folder</p>
    <img src="html_logo_200.png" alt="HTML5 logo">
    <p>we can also load images that are inside subfolders.</p>
    <img src="images/css3_logo_200.png" alt="CSS3 logo">
    <p>We can also load external image files</p>
    <img src="https://logospng.org/download/javascript/logo-javascript-256.png" alt="JavaScript logo">
    <p>Though these differences can't be spotted here, they're different from one another in terms of how we get one and how we get the other, for they require different "techiques" in order to achieve the expected result.</p>

<!--In order to select a specific image file from a folder or any other place within your computer files, for example, all ye got to do is type img and then press the return key, place the cursor in between the double quotation marks of "src", then ye hold the control key and press the space key. A list of available images is going to pop up. To load an image file that's inside a subfolder, all ye got to do is repeat the same procedure, except that this time ye must select the subfolder and then select the desired image file that's inside it.
Notice that the HTML5 and CSS3 logos got scaled to 200, which's and ideal size for a website page.

To get an image file from an external source on the web, all ye got to do is select the desired image file and then copy the image URL and then paste this URL within the quotation marks of "src". URL stands for "Uniform Resource Locator"-->
