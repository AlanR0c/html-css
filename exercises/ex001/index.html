    <h1>Hello fuckin world!</h1> <!--'h1' is the heading-->
    <hr> <!--'hr' stands for horizontal row-->
    <p>This is me first HTML document, hurrah!</p> <!--'p' stands for paragraph-->
    <br> <!--'br' means 'line break' in HTML-->       
    <p>This is me first web fuckin site!</p>
    
    <p>According to scaler.com, it's bad practice to use the 'br' tag to separate paragraphs of text. They continue by saying that, instead, we should use the 'p' tag.</p>

    <p>Notice that I've used the 'br' tag above, right after the 'This is me first HTML document, hurrah!' sentence. It's noticeable that it skips two lines, as though ye pressed return twice.</p>

    <p>The 'hr' tag produces a horizontal line or, as its name suggests, a horizontal row; which appears right under the 'Hello fuckin world!' sentence.</p>
