Eg 20px 20px -> it's going to move to content 20px to the right-hand side and 20px downwards. Note that it can also take negative values, which then inverts the way the content is moved. Eg, -20px -20px is going to move the content 20px to the left-hand side and 20px upwards. -50% -50% means that now we got the content equally centred, both horizontally and vertically.*/

<!--Guanabara mentions that, every single time you're going to vertically centre things, you must have a container and the content inside this container.

He also mentions that margin: auto; only works for centre align.

He explains that box position in HTML and CSS will always be relative.

Then he mentions that the rule of thumb regarding container and its contents is as follows: the container will always have position: relative and the content will be set to position: absolute. By doing this, ye can easily adjust the position of the content inside the container by using left and top, since the position is absolute. Eg, left 100px; top 200px;

The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.-->
