    <h1>The Picture Tag</h1>
    <p>The &ltpicture&gt tag gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.</p>
    <p>Try and access this website using different devices or simply zoom in and out on yer internet browser:</p>
        <picture>
            <source media="(max-width: 750px)" srcset="images/pic_small.png" type="image/png">
            <source media="(max-width: 1050px)" srcset="images/pic_medium.png" type="image/png">
            <img src="images/pic_large.png" alt="flexible image">
        </picture>
    <h1>HTML Audio</h1>
    <p>To play and audio file in HTML5, use the &ltaudio&gt element:</p>
        <!--<audio src="audio/we_cruisin.mp3" autoplay controls></audio>If ye don't use the parameters 'autoplay' and 'controls', the audio file will not play on the website. This autoplay doesn't work on Google Chrome, which means that this way is rather limited when it comes to compatibility. Instead, ye should use the follow way below:-->
        <audio preload="metadata" autoplay controls> <!--We can use the parameter 'loop' after 'controls'-->
            <source src="audio/we_cruisin.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"><!--The 'audio/mpeg' is the mp3 media type parameter, 'audio/ogg' is the ogg one and 'audio/wav' is the wav one. The website will first try and play the mp3 one. If sth goes wrong and it can't play the mp3 file, he then goes to the next format, which is ogg; if the ogg is not playable, it then tries the next one which is the wav file and so on and so forth. -->
            <source src="audio/we_cruisin.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
            <source src="audio/we_cruisin.wav" type="audio/wav">
            <p>Unfortunately the chosen file cannot be played. <a href="audio/we_cruisin.mp3">Click here</a> to download it.</p><!--If the website can't play any file, we can display an error message to the user and even provide a link so that they're able to download the file. Note that wav format is not recommended to to be used when it comes to play a file on a website, for they're unnecessary large files.-->

<!--The most common use of the <picture> element will be for art direction in responsive designs. Instead of having one image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple images can be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport. The <picture> element contains two tags: one or more <source> tags and one <img> tag. The browser will look for the first <source> element where the media query matches the current viewport width, and then it will display the proper image (specified in the srcset attribute).

The <img> element is required as the last child of the <picture> element, as a fallback option if none of the source tags matches. <br>Tip: The <picture> element works "similar" to <video> and <audio>. You set up different sources, and the first source that fits the preferences is the one being used.
The <source> tag is used to specify multiple media resources for media elements, such as <video>, <audio>, and <picture>.

The <source> tag allows you to specify alternative video/audio/image files which the browser may choose from, based on browser support or viewport width. The browser will choose the first <source> it supports.

Guanabara says that he prefers to use the max-width instead of the min-width, the latter being the default parameter. He explains that, by default, the website will load the image source that we set, which's <img src="images/pic_large.png" alt="flexible image">, which's the large picture. If the browser supports less than 1000px, which's the size of our large picture, then the website is going to load the medium picture, which's got a size of 700px. And this is declared above the default image(the large one): <source media="(max-width: 1050px)" srcset="images/pic_medium.png" type="image/png">. If the browser doesn't support the 700px size, then it goes to the smallest one. This is declared above the medium one, like so: <source media="(max-width: 750px)" srcset="images/pic_small.png" type="image/png">

I've tried to use the the 'min-width' parameter and inverted the order of the images, ie, from the small one to the big one, but it didn't work at all.

The 'preload' parameter got 3 basic elements: auto, metadata and none. The auto is going to consider that the webpage if fully loaded only when all the audio files have been loaded,  which means that if we got large files, it's going to be too heavy and slow. The 'metadata' one loads some information, such as the names, duration etc, which renders it the best option, unlike 'auto'. 

Guanabara says that we must stick to small files when it comes to be played on a website. Files with richer quality must be used only if they're to be downloaded, otherwise, they should never be used to be played or displayed on a website, and that's simply because they're large files that would simply make everything laggy.-->
