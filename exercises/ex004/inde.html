<!--In this lesson Guanabara explains how to create favicons using three methods: 1- looking for an icon on Google, using iconarchive.com or favicon.io
It's vital to remember that in order to add a favicon, ye must type link, right above the "tittle tag", then we must select "link favicon". Once this is done then we got to choose our favicon file, and the procedure is really similar to that of selecting an image file. ie, all we got to do is place the cursor inside the double quotation marks of "href", hold the control key and then pressing the space key and then you'll be able to select the desired favicon file.-->
