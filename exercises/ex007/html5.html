<!--In this lesson Guanabara explains the difference between HTML5 and CSS3. HTML provides web page structure(or as Guabanara said, HTML is all about meaning and semantics; CSS is all about style and format), whereas CSS is mainly used to control web styling. Guanabara goes on explaining that HTML5 doens't focus on format, instead it focus on semantics and things that got a specific meaning. He also mentions that some tags aren't simply working anymore on HTML5, and he urges to pay attention to things that are obsolete nowadays. Remember, any sort of animations are done with JavaScript.
